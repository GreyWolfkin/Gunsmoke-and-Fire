  storyText: Castellan looks you up and down, hard. "You get one shot, Rothyk. One
    more chance. Don't screw this up." He hands you an envelope. Like every one before
    it, the envelope is stained with splotches of yellow and brown, sealed with a
    midnight-blue wax. The wax had been broken, and the neatly-folded letter had
    been returned to the envelope. You remove the letter and open it with shaking
    hands.
