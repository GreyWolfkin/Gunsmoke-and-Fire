  storyText: 'The smell of gunsmoke brings you to your feet.

    Not a drunken night.
    A shoot-out. But with who? And why?

    You look around the destroyed office.
    Whoever you scuffled with, you two really went gashouse.

    The side of your
    head feels warm. You put a hand to your hair and it comes away sticky. Blood.
    A lot of it. Someone slugged you good, but they didn''t finish the job.'
