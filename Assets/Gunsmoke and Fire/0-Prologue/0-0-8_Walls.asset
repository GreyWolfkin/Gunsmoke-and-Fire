  storyText: You inspect the walls. Bullet holes, but also scorch marks and the telltale
    smell of fire magic. Marks on the far side of the office, you probably made those.
    But there are also marks on your side of the room. So whoever you tussled with,
    you weren't the only one throwing spells around.
  optText: Examine the walls
