  storyText: 'Harald''s Bar. You''ve spent a lot of nights in the gin mill. The booze
    isn''t good, but it''s cheap, and Harald has a way of reading a person. Some
    nights you come in and he''ll chat like the two of you used to drink out of the
    same bottle. Other nights he''ll have you poured before you sit down, and the
    slosh of liquor into your glass is the only thing you''ll hear out of him. He''s
    good company.

    The other advantage is that Harald''s is a dive. You can
    always find some junkie if you need information, or a couple dumb mugs if you
    just need a fight.'
