  storyText: 'At the moment, the bar is closed up, no lights shine through the shuttered
    windows.

    You know Harald lives over the bar. If you urgently needed to
    talk to him, you could always head up the ladder and bang on the outside door
    until he wakes up.

    Otherwise, if you think there''s anything of value in
    the alley behind the bar, you could poke around a bit.

    Or you could head
    back to the Office.'
