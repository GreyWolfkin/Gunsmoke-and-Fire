  storyText: 'You pull the package out of the drain pipe and unwrap it. Inside is
    a note and a small vial, a healing potion. Valuable stuff.

    You read over
    the note.

    "This one''s duck-soup, Monty. Sell for $30, drop the cash. Do
    it right, the next supply will be bigger. Screw it up and you''re done for."

    You
    pocket the potion, tuck the note back inside the packaging and stuff it back
    into the drain pipe. This Monty is some small-time mook running a racket on healing
    items, You don''t mind putting him behind the eight-ball, and the potion might
    do you some good.'
