  storyText: '"I''m in a bad way, Harald. I think I''ve been shot," you say.

    Harald
    opens the door all the way. You turn your head to reveal the mat of hair. His
    eyes widen slightly.

    "Christ, Leo. Come on in."

    You follow him into
    the dim, smoky apartment. Harald reaches a lamp and flicks it on.

    He gestures
    to a low chair by the radio. "Sit down. Let me get you a rag."'
