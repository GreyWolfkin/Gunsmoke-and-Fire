  storyText: '"Not sure I know," you admit. "Woke up like this in my office. Seems
    like there was some kind of a shoot-out, but I''ve got no idea who clipped me.
    The only reason I''m alive is this head wound. I''m guessing when they saw me
    lying in a pool of blood they thought they''d done the job."

    they leave any clues behind?" Harald is looking at you with a mixture of concern
    and curiosity.
