  storyText: "You grab your coat, thinking over what you've learned. Some hard customer
    found you in your office. There was a shoot-out. They clipped you in the head
    and put you to sleep. Then they went through the place, stole evidence from a
    four year-old cold case, and made a clean sneak. You try to remember their face,
    but everything's hazy.\r\n\r\nWho tried to kill you? None of Rich's boys use
    magic. The Li's are doing a three-spot up north. Jimmy Donovan did the dance
    two months ago, you watched him swing.\r"
