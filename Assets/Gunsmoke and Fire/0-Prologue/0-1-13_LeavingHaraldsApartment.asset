  storyText: '"Thanks for the rag, Harald. I should try to get home," you say, standing.

    "You
    sure you''re gonna be okay?"

    Honestly, you feel woozy, but some part of
    you is screaming to get home. There''s something back home that you need. That
    you have to get to. You''re not sure what, but it''s important.

    "Yeah,
    I''ll be fine. Sorry to wake you."

    He shakes his head. "Come by the bar
    tomorrow. And I''ll keep my ear to the ground. If I hear anything, I''ll give
    you the wire."

    You nod in thanks, and head out the door. It locks quietly
    behind you.'
