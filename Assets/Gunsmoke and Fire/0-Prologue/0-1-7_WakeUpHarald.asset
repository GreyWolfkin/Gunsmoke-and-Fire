  storyText: 'You climb the ladder to the outside door of Harald''s apartment. You
    pound on the door four times. Shortly you hear rustling from inside. A low thump
    is followed by a sharp curse, and then the locks on the door turn. Harald opens
    the door a crack.

    "Who the fuck is... Leo? Leo what the hell are you doing
    getting me out of bed at this hour?"

    You open your mouth to speak, and
    then a thought stops you in your tracks.

    You have no idea who came after
    you. No idea who they were working with. Do you really want to start spitting
    about what happened?

    But surely you can trust Harald, right?'
