    You''ll need to explore the streets of CITY NAME to find
    your way back to your apartment. When Detective Hearn recognizes a landmark,
    it''ll get added to your journal.

    Along the way, you''ll have the opportunity
    to search certain locations or find hidden items. These may help you later.

    But
    watch out! If you wind up in a situation you can''t talk your way out of, there
    might be a scuffle.

    If this happens, you''ll need to devise a strategy
    for dealing with the enemy.

    As always, use the number keys to navigate
    or choose options in a fight.
